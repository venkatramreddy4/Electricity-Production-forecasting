Electricity Production Forecasting Using Time Series Analytics
Implemented 8 step methods of forecasting from Exploratory data analysis to model implementation Step 1: Defining Goal, Step 2: Getting data, Step 3: Explore and Visualize Series
Step 4: Data Preprocessing, Step 5: Partition Series, Step 6 & 7: Apply Forecasting & Comparing Performance, Step 8: Implement Forecast
The aim of this project is to Forecast Electricity Production data for the upcoming months of 2018 and 2019. The goal is to create a Time series forecast predictive model which will properly consider the components of the historical data and effectively forecast the desired months. Naturally, the model with the highest accuracy will be considered the model of choice. The resulting forecasts will be used to monitor the Forecasting of Electricity Production.
After implementing different models Based on metric values, the Auto ARIMA model has performed better than the Regression model with Quadratic Trend and Seasonality on both metrics, as lower values of RMSE and MAPE indicate better predictive accuracy. The Auto ARIMA model's lower errors suggest that it is more capable of capturing the underlying patterns in the data and making more accurate predictions.
